# Firebase Setup Guide for Quoridor PWA

## 1. Create Project on Firebase Console

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click **"Add project"** and name it (e.g., `quoridor-pwa`).
3. Disable Google Analytics (optional, easier for setup) and click **"Create project"**.

## 2. Enable Services

Once the project is created, you need to enable the services we used in the code:

### Authentication
1. Go to **Build > Authentication** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **"Get started"**.
3. Select **"Email/Password"** from the Sign-in method list.
4. Toggle **"Enable"** and click **"Save"**.

### Cloud Firestore (Database)
1. Go to **Build > Firestore Database**.
2. Click **"Create database"**.
3. Choose a location (e.g., `nam5 (us-central)`).
4. Choose **"Start in test mode"** (for development purposes) or "Production mode".
   - *Note: Test mode allows anyone to read/write for 30 days. For production, you will need security rules.*
5. Click **"Create"**.

## 3. Local Configuration (Connecting App to Firebase)

You need to link this Flutter code to your Firebase project.

1. **Install Firebase Tools** (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Log in**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Configure FlutterFire**:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   - Select your project (`quoridor-pwa`) using the arrow keys.
   - Select platforms: `web`, `android`, `ios`.
   - This will automatically generate/update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with the correct API Keys and App IDs for your project.

## 4. Build and Deploy to Firebase Hosting

To host your PWA on the web:

1. **Initialize Hosting** (Already done in this project via `firebase.json`, but good to know):
   - The `firebase.json` is configured to serve files from `build/web`.

2. **Build the Web App**:
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```
   - This compiles your Dart code into HTML/JS in the `build/web` folder.

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
   - This uploads the `build/web` folder to Firebase.
   - It will give you a URL (e.g., `https://quoridor-pwa.web.app`) where you can play the game.

## Credentials

To compile and deploy "here" (if you were asking about this environment or a CI server), you generally need:
- **Flutter SDK**: To run `flutter build`.
- **Firebase Token**: A CI token generated via `firebase login:ci` if running in an automated pipeline.

Since you are running this interactively or locally:
- Your **Google Account** login (via `firebase login`) is the credential needed.
- The **`lib/firebase_options.dart`** file (generated by `flutterfire configure`) contains the non-secret public keys that the app uses to talk to Firebase.
